Khoisanid (Capoid) types
Very ancient phenotypes, typical for Khoi and San peoples in Southern Africa.

Strandlooper, described as a Proto-Khoisanid type.
Sanid
Typical for the San (formerly known as Bushmen) peoples in the western parts of South Africa and Namibia.

Kalaharid, or Sanid proper.
Karroid, a more southern variety.
Khoid
Typical for the Khoi peoples in the western parts of South Africa and Namibia.

Khoid, or Khoid proper.
Tanzanian Khoid
Some indigenous groups in Tanzania speak isolated languages that have traditionally been described as "Khoi-San". They are completely different to the Bantu peoples who make up the majority of the country.

Hadza, a Khoid subtype mixed with Bantuid and Bambutid.
Sandawe, a Khoid subtype mixed with Bantuid and Ethiopid.
Africoid types
Types of peoples indigenous to the African continent south of the Sahara who are comparatively more recent than the Khoisanid types listed above. Sometimes the term "Negroid" is used (as in the name of the wiki category to which the following types belong), but this term may be considered dated and offensive.

Bambutid
More ancient types, typical for the Pygmy peoples (sometimes called the "Forest Peoples") of the forests of Central Africa.

East Bambutid, or Bambutid proper, representing the Mbuti.
West Bambutid, a more western variety, representing the Mbenga.
Twa–Cwa, a more southern variety, mixed with Congolid.
Southern Africoid
A super-category that includes both the Bantuid types (which make up the majority of Southern Africa) and far less populous types in the region that predate the Bantu and their ancient expansion.

Katangid, pre-Bantuid type of Southern Africa.
Mountain Dama, pre-Congolid type of Southwestern Africa.
Bantuid
Typical for the Bantu peoples of Africa, especially in the southern part. Many speakers of Bantu languages belong to more northern phenotypes such as Congolid.

North Bantuid, a northern variety in East Africa. Most common in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and surrounding regions.
Central Bantuid, a central variety in the southern parts of Central Africa. Most common in Angola, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
Chopi–Tswana, a more southern Central Bantuid type. Most common in Botswana and parts of South Africa.
South Bantuid, a southern variety in South Africa. Most common among the Zulu and Swazi in South Africa and Eswatini. Comprises of a few subtypes.
Fengu–Pondo, a more southern South Bantuid type. Most common in Lesotho and parts of South Africa.
Xhosaid, a more southeastern South Bantuid type. Most common among the Xhosa in South Africa. They are more mixed with Khoisanids, specifically those of the Sanid variety.
Western Africoid
Another super-category that includes the similar Congolid and Sudanid types of Central and West Africa, representing the northern branches of the Niger–Congo language family. These are the types with which many Westerners will be more familiar, as most of the ancestors of Black Americans (in the sense of Black people in the Western Hemisphere) came from these parts of Africa, so they tend to have these phenotypes.

Congolid
Typical for peoples indigenous to the forests of Central and West Africa.

Congolesid, or Congolid proper. Most common in both Congos and neighbouring regions.
West Congolesid, a more western variety. Most common in Gabon, Cameroon and neighbouring regions.

Guineo-Camerunian, a similar type found in the same regions, with more Congolesid elements.
Igboid, a subtype of Guineo-Camerunian most common among the Igbo people from Nigeria.
Sudano-Guinesid, a more northern type found between the Sahel and the West African forests (especially Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Nigeria), mixed with Sudanid. This may be the most common phenotype of African Americans, whose mixed West African ancestors came from regions with both Sudanid and Guinesid populations.
Casamance, a far-western Sudano-Guinesid type. Most common in the Senegalese region after which it is named.
Mundu–Mangbeto, a more eastern variety, somewhat mixed with Nilo-Hamitic and Bambutic. Most common in the eastern Central African Republic.

Danakil, a more northeastern type. Most common in Djibouti and neighbouring desert regions.
Central Ethiopid, a more central variety. Most common in Ethiopia.
North Ethiopid, a more northern or northwestern variety. Most common in Eritrea.

Europoid (Caucasoid) types
Types of peoples indigenous to Europe and West/South Asia (a region that some geneticists group together as "Western Eurasia"), as well as North Africa. Sometimes the term "Caucasoid" is used (as in the name of the wiki category to which the following types belong), but the attested term "Europoid" is slightly more inclusive, although not all phenotypes within this category are native to the European continent.
